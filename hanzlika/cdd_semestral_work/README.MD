This semestral CDD analysis is focused in finding differences between compounds that act promiscuously and those that do not.

For this purpose, we will work with three sets.

- safe - a random sample of 10K compounds that were active in 0 out of 106 pubchem assays
- sus - compounds active in >=4 pubchem assays
- highly_sus - compounds active in >=8 pubchem assays
- chembl - random 10K compounds from chembl 34
